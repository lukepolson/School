    "The mean ionization potential $I$ is a geometric mean of all ionization and excitation potentials of atoms of the absorbing material. It is through these absorption pathways in the material (excitiation and ionization) that an incident charged particle beam will lose energy and transfer it to the material. As such, $I$ plays a crucial role in determining the stopping power of a material, since stopping power is a measure of how a charged particle beam will deposit energy in a material. Furthermore, stopping power is a statistical average: this is precisely why **only the mean ionization potential** is required: not all excitation pathways need to be concidered in the formula. If one, however, was interested in the stochastic quantity $dE/dx$, the relative probability of individual excitiation and ionization pathways would need to be considered (and the formula, which would now be of random variables, would be significantly more complicated)."
