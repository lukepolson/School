    "So $|\\gamma|$ is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the correction term $F$ and four orders of magnitude smaller than the main term. The factor $\\gamma$ corrects for the fact that water is partially polarized. In particular, for an electron travelling through the medium, coloumb interactions with distant molecules are slightly reduced due to a shielding effect that occurs. This serves to reduce the strength of the coloumb interaction and correspondingly decrease the rate of energy deposition in the medium. This is precisely what occurs here; since $\\gamma$ is positive, the rate of energy deposition (stopping power) is reduced, but only by an order of about 0.01%"
