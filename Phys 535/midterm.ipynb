    "* Assuming $Y_1$ is still points in the superior direction, the anterior-posterior pair could use $Y_2=0$ to match the junction of the two beam pairs. The extent of $Y_1$  will depend on the size of the supraclavical lymph nodes that need to be irradiated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively this makes sense; the two pairs of beams only differ by the rotation of the gantry; if we want them to have an overlapping junction along a horizontal line in the figure above, one pair must have $Y_1=0$ and the other must have $Y_2=0$ (since they share a common isocenter). \n",
    "\n",
    "A few precautions also have to be made due to the fact that there is also the other photon and electron beam. The value of $X_1$ for the two beam pairs **will need to be different**. While the tangential beam has $X_1=0$, the anterior posterior beam will need to have a value of $X_1$ that permits alignment the electron beam and the anterior-posterior beam at the surface of the patient. See the diagram below; note how the anterior-posterior beam needs to have beam on both the left ($X_1$ direction) and right ($X_2$ direction) of its CAX."

    "The precautions are apparent in the diagram above: the intersection of the anterior-posterior beam and the tilted electron beam (predominantly inside the lung) need to bea accounted for. The addition of these two fields inside the lung could be quite damaging. This might involve using a lower energy photon beam for the anterior-posterior beam pair, to ensure that the photons don't travel as far inside the body. In addition, one may choose to have a smaller value of $X_1$ for the anterior-posterior pair. This would remove the alignment of the electron field and the anterior-posterior pair at the surface, but would lessen the dose on the side of the lung closest to the heart."
