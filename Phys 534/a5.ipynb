    "There are three main sources of natural background:\n",

    "1) **Cosmic Radiation**, where high energy particles from space interact with the atmosphere and produce showers of lighter particles. The main factor that leads to variations in individual exposure are altitude. The approximate annual dose exposure is $\\sim 0.3$mSv, depending on location.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Terrestrial Radiation**, where radioisotopes from the soil emit radiation. The intensity of the radiation depends on the geology of the region, and the approximate annual dose is $\\sim 0.35$mSv, but this largely depends on location. For example, this value is 0.25mSv in Victoria bu 0.63mSv in Kelowna.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Internal Radioactivity**: radioactivity from radioisotopes injested from food or incorporated in the body.The average annual dose is around 0.35mSv, and variation is due to varying diets of individuals."

    "a) **Primary Barrier**: The primary barrier of the treatment room consists of the walls/ceiling/floor of a room and is the first object irradiated directly by photons from the target or source. The width of the primary barrier must by at least the size of the diagonal of the largest beam used + 30 cm to each side. \n",
    "\n",
    "b) **Leakage Radiation**: Originates in the x-ray target or radionuclide source and is transmitted through the shielded head of the therapy machine. To account for the energy of this radiation, a secondary barrier is constructed for adequate attenuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) **Use Factor U**: The fraction of beam-on time where the beam is directed towards a particular barrier. These values for floor, walls, and ceiling are typically 1, 0.25, and 0.25 (primary barriers). For all secondary barriers, $U=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) **Workload W**: The machine output in Gy/week or Gy/year at a well defined point (typically the machine isocenter at 100cm from the source). This workload consists of radiation from both clinical workload (treatment of patients) and physics workload (machine calibration). A typical workload (Lecture 19 Slide 35) is about 43000Gy/year.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) **Occupancy Factor T**: A factor which the workload is multiplied with to account for the degree of occupancy in the area of question. For offices, adjacent treatment rooms, corridors/employee lounges, and waiting rooms, the factors are typically 1, 0.5, 0.2, and 0.125 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "f) **Tenth Value Layer**: the thickness of a specified material that attenuates radiation to an extent such that the air kerma rate, exposure rate, or absorbed dose rate is reduced to one-tenth of the initial value. Typical tenth value layers range from about 5cm (lead, energy 1-50MeV) to 50cm (concrete, energy 50MeV).\n",
    "\n",
    "g) **ALARA Principle:** \"As low as reasonably achievable\". Radiation sources and installations should be provided with the best available protection such that magnitudes and likelihood of exposures are as low as reasonably achievable. The exposure to healthy tissue should be kept to a minimum necessary to achieve the diagnostic/therapeutic objective"
