# Monte Carlo Simulation

* The script `functions.py` contains all necessary functions for simulating this project. 
* The script `run_events.py` is used to run the simulation. 
* The notebook `make_plots.ipynb` was used to generate all plots from data obtained from `run_events.py`

Code was ran on Compute Canada; 100 parallel occurances of `run_events.py` were used to generate 100 seperate groups of histograms that were then summed together in the end. 1 billion total events were simulated.
